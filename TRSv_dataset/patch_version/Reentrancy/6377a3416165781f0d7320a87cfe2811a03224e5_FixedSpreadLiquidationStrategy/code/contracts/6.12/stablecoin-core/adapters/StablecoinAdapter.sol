/*
    Here we provide *adapters* to connect the BookKeeper to arbitrary external
    token implementations, creating a bounded context for the BookKeeper. The
    adapters here are provided as working examples:

      - `TokenAdapter`: For well behaved ERC20 tokens, with simple transfer
                   semantics.

      - `StablecoinAdapter`: For connecting internal Alpaca Stablecoin balances to an external
                   `AlpacaStablecoin` implementation.

    In practice, adapter implementations will be varied and specific to
    individual collateral types, accounting for different transfer
    semantics and token standards.

    Adapters need to implement two basic methods:

      - `deposit`: enter token into the system
      - `withdraw`: remove token from the system
